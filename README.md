### Introduction

PDML is an informal markup language written in 100% PHP, allowing to
create complex PDF documents very easily for people already familiar with
HTML. People familiar with PHP can also use it as a way to define templates
for dynamic PDF documents.
The PDML project was developed by Henri T. (metal_hurlant). Because we
think this project is very useful we want to continue this project.
PDML is built on top of FPDF, and is licensed under the GPL
